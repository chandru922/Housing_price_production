Housing Price Prediction using Linear Regression
This project aims to predict housing prices using a Linear Regression model in Python. Linear Regression is a simple yet powerful machine learning algorithm that can be used for predicting numerical values, such as housing prices based on various features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and more.

Project Overview
In this project, we will build a Linear Regression model to predict housing prices. The goal is to create a model that can accurately estimate the price of a house based on a set of input features. This can be useful for real estate agents, homeowners, and potential buyers to get a rough estimate of a property's value.

Dataset
We will use a dataset containing various attributes of houses and their corresponding sale prices. The dataset is available in the data directory and is named housing_data.csv. You can download and use your own dataset if needed.
